# anhydrofit: an R package for the analysis of anhydrobiosis recovery data

Anhydrobiosis experiments are used to test many biological and evolutionary questions. In anhyrobiosis experiments, different experimental groups of animals are desiccated and rehydrated in controlled conditions. Following rehydration, how many animals recovered their motility is checked at regular time intervals. The **anhydrofit** package provides tools to analyze data from such experiments.

## Installation

Installing from the GitLab repository should be as easy as typing:

    # Run inside an R session
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("tardipede/anhydrofit", quiet = TRUE)

Next, you can visit the [documentation for the latest stable version](https:).
